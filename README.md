### WalkInWallet allows you to walk in wallets as you walk in galleries.

WalkInWallet is an open-source React project that allows you to walk through wallets as you would walk in galleries. It generates a random 3D gallery out of every NFT in your wallet. The project is based on [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/) for the 3D rendering. The galleries are created using *the wallet address as a seed* for the random function, ensuring that a gallery would only be extended by new NFTs but never changed completely. The application is built on the [Cardano blockchain](https://cardano.org/discover-cardano/) and uses [Koios](https://www.koios.rest/) to query the chain data.
